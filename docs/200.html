			<div>
				<p>
					Setting up older Cisco phones requires that your DHCP server is configurable to allow
					the addition of option 150 for TFTP. Most home and small business routers with built in
					DHCP servers do not provide the ability to add options for DHCP so it will be
					necessary to setup a DHCP server capable of adding DHCP options. The best option may be
					to use the Raspberry Pi running FreePBX but other options include other Linux machines
					or Windows Server.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide will not go into setting up DHCP to support Cisco IP Phones. Search for options
					on setting up a DHCP server on the platform of your choice. The following are some
					high-level steps to a sucessful installation.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If at all possible, run your VoIP equipment on a separate VLAN from the rest of your
						network traffic. This will improve your overall experience and will help isolate issues.
					</li>
					<li>
						The machine that will be your DHCP Server must have a static IP Address. Setting a static
						IP Address should be one of the first steps.
					</li>
					<li>
						Before starting up your DHCP Server (DHCP Service/Daemon/Process) turn off the current
						DHCP server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the following Options to your DHCP Sever at a minimum
						<ul>
							<li>003 Router - IP Address of the Router/Gateway</li>
							<li>006 DNS Servers - List of IP Address(es) for DNS Servers</li>
							<li>
								150 Cisco IPT - IP Address of the TFTP Server. The IP Address will be the IP Address
								of the FreePBX Server unless you plan to use a different machine for TFTP.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Step 1 - Setup TFTP Server on the Raspberry PI</h2>
		<p>
			Cisco IP Phones require a connection to a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) Server on start-up to retrieve an XML file for provisioning the phone. The IP Phone will connect to the TFTP Server specified by the DHCP response or through the network configuration set locally on the phone. The issue with the locally stored network configuration, is the menu to set the configuration is not accessable after the phone is reset. Therefore it is necessary to have option 150 set in the DHCP Server configuration.
		</p>
		<p>
			This step will guide you through the stepup of the TFTP Server on the Raspberry Pi to support Cisco IP Phones.

		<ol>
			<li>
				Log into the Raspberry Pi
			</li>
			<li>
				Install the xinetd tftp package by typing the following command<br />
				root@raspbx:~# apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp
			</li>
			<li>
				Press the Enter key when prompted to accept the default values<br />
				Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
			</li>
			<li>
				Create/edit the tftp configuration file by typing the following command<br />
				nano /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
			</li>
			<li>
				Add/edit the file with the following contents<br />
				<span class="code">service tftp
{
protocol        = udp
port            = 69
socket_type     = dgram
wait            = yes
user            = nobody
server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args     = /tftpboot
disable         = no
}
</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Exit and save the file by doing the following
				<ol>
					<li>ctrl+x</li>
					<li>Y</li>
					<li>Enter</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Stop and start the xinetd service by issuing the following commands:<br />
				root@raspbx:~# /etc/init.d/xinetd stop<br />
				root@raspbx:~# /etc/init.d/xinetd start
			</li>
			<li>
				Check the status of the tftp xinetd service by issuing the following command:<br />
				root@raspbx:~# /etc/init.d/xinetd status
			</li>

		</ol>
