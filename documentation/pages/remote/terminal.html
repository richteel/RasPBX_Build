                    This guide will walk you through connecting to a RasPBX installation using PuTTY.

                <h2>Items required</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi with RasPBX installed</li>
                    <li>A Computer with <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PuTTY</a> software installed</li>
                    <li>An active network connection between the RasPBX and the remote computer</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    If SSH is enabled on the Raspberry Pi, it is possible to administer the Raspberry Pi from another computer.
                    You may use <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PuTTY</a>
                    to run commands and <a href="https://winscp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WinSCP</a>
                    to transfer files between your PC and the Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may be able to connect to the Raspberry Pi using raspbx.local but if that does not work, you will
                    need to find the IP Address for the Raspberry Pi. There are a few ways to find the IP Address. The most
                    straight forward way is to log into the Raspberry Pi and run the command "ifconfig" to obtain the IP
                    Address. Another method is to go to your router or DHCP server and look at the list of leases. Your
                    Raspberry Pi may be listed as "RASPBX". Note the IP Address and use it in PuTTY or WinSCP to connect
                    to the Raspberry Pi.<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>NOTE:</b> It is suggested that you give your Raspberry Pi a static IP Address. There are several ways
                    to assign a static IP Address. You may setup the Raspberry Pi to use a static IP Address or you may
                    create a reservation on your DHCP server.

                        You may see a PuTTY Security Alert dialog pop-up stating that the server's host key is not cached in the registry. If
                        you see this dialog, click the "Yes" button to continue.<br />
