                <p>
                    When receiving a used or refurbished Cisco 79xx, it is generally a good idea to reset the phone to clear any passwords
                    or configuration that may cause issues with connecting your IP Phone to your RasPBX instance. All of the 
                    instructions given here are modified slightly from Cisco's website. The original Cisco instructions are found at 
                    <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/voice-unified-communications/unified-ip-phone-7900-series/15254-7960-default.html">

                    </a>. I only have two types of Cisco phones, which are CP-7941G and CP-7975G. The instructions here are for these two models. For 
                    other 79xx models, please refer to the Cisco website.

                    Complete these steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Ensure that the following are in place before attempting a reset of the phone:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    DHCP server has Scope Option 150 set and pointing to the IP Address of your TFTP server
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Have the TFTP server running
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Have the firmware files and XML Configuration files in the proper locations on the TFT Server
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unplug the power cable from the phone, and then plug in the cable again. <br />
                            The phone begins its power up cycle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Immediately press and hold # and while the Headset, Mute, and Speaker buttons begin to flash in sequence, release #.<br />
                            The line buttons flash in sequence in order to indicate that the phone waits for you to enter the key sequence for the reset.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Press 123456789*0# within 60 seconds after the Headset, Mute, and Speaker buttons begin to flash.<br />
                            NOTES:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If you repeat a key within the sequence, for example, if you press 1223456789*0#, the sequence is still accepted 
                                    and the phone resets.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you do not complete this key sequence or do not press any keys, after 60 seconds the Headset, Mute, and Speaker 
                                    buttons no longer flash, and the phone continues with its normal startup process. The phone does not reset.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you enter an invalid key sequence, the buttons no longer flash, and the phone continues with its normal 
                                    startup process. The phone does not reset.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    If you enter this key sequence correctly, the phone displays this prompt:<br />
